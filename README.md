# Briefing-Notes

## What are Briefing Notes Reports?
Rishidot Research or StackSense.io will publish briefing notes reports from time to time based on vendor briefings. 
Our analysts will publish these articles based on the relative importance of the briefings to their areas of research.

A typical Briefing Notes report will include:
* Market Overview
* Vendor Announcement
* Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis, 
which will be available separately in the [SWOT repo](https://github.com/rishidot/SWOT)
* Conclusion
* Links to the location of any supporting data that was used 

Typically, a Briefing Notes report is an alternative to a blog post written by an analyst about a vendor briefing 
and will always include a SWOT analysis so that buyers can make informed decisions

## Why are you publishing it as a Markdown format in a Github repo?
Rishidot Research (and StackSense.io) believe in publishing their reports openly and sharing their data openly. 
Github is a perfect place to host our research collateral and publications. 

We publish our reports in Markdown because we believe it will help multiple usecases including easy republishing. 
Since Markdown is machine readable, our reports can be a good data source used in any Machine Learning or AI context.
