# Briefing-Notes

##What is Briefing Notes?
Rishidot Research or StackSense.io will publish briefing notes from time to time based on the vendor briefings. Our analysts will publish these Briefing Notes from time to time based on the briefings they receive and the relative importance of the briefings to their areas of research.

A typical Briefing Notes will include
* Market Overview
* Vendor Announcement
* SWOT Analysis (available separately in another repo)
* Conclusion
* A link to the repository of any data that was used will be provided

Typically, a Briefing Note is an alternative to a blog post written by an analyst about a vendor briefing and will always include a SWOT analysis so that buyers can make informed decisions

##Why are you publishing it as a Markdown format in a Github repo?
Rishidot Research (and StackSense.io) believes in publishing their reports openly and sharing their data openly. Github is a perfect place to host our research collateral and publications. We publish our reports in Markdown because we believe it will help multiple usecases including easy republishing. Since Mardown is machine readable, our reports can be a good data source used in any Machine Learning or AI context.
