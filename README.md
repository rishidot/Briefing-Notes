##What is Briefing Notes?
Rishidot Research or Stacksense.io will publish briefing notes from time to time based on the vendor briefings. Our analysts will publish these Briefing Notes from time to time based on the briefings they receive and the relative importance of the briefings to their areas of research.

A typical Briefing Notes will include
* Market Overview
* Vendor Announcement
* SWOT Analysis (available separately in another repo)
* Conclusion
* A link to the repository of any data that was used will be provided
Typically, a Briefing Note is an alternative to a blog post written by an analyst about a vendor briefing and will always include a SWOT analysis so that buyers can make informed decisions
##Why are you publishing it in Markdown in a Github repo?
